# Alvin Yearby Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challege I created a professional porfolio using the knowledge of HTML and CSS that I have learned so far. I used flex box and containers and media queries so that the contents in my portfolio would adjust to any smaller screen size that it will be presented on. I also used CSS to give the portfolio and layout and design to make it look somewhat presentable.
